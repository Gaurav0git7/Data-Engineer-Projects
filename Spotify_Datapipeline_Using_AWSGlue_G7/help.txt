Step 4: Open Power BI Desktop
Open Power BI Desktop on your computer.
Step 2: Get Data (CSV)
In Power BI Desktop, click on the Home tab at the top.
Click on Get Data in the toolbar.
From the dropdown menu, choose CSV (this will allow you to load a CSV file directly from your computer).
Step 3: Select the CSV File
Navigate to the location on your computer where the CSV file is stored (e.g., the file exported from your Jupyter Notebook).
Select the CSV file and click Open.
Step 4: Preview and Load Data
Power BI will display a Preview of the data from the CSV file.

If the data looks correct, click Load to import the data into Power BI.

If you need to perform data transformations (like cleaning or reshaping the data), click on Transform Data to open the Power Query Editor before loading the data.
Step 5: Analyze and Visualize Data
Once the data is loaded, you can start creating visualizations.
In the Fields pane on the right, drag and drop columns onto the Report canvas to create tables, bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.
You can filter and customize the visualizations to analyze the data in different ways.
Step 6: Create Insights and Reports
Use Power BI’s various visualization options (like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.) to analyze trends, patterns, and insights from your data.
You can create multiple pages, add filters, and create interactive dashboards to represent your analysis.
Example Analysis:
Create a Table:
Drag columns like song_name, artist, and popularity onto the Table visualization to display a detailed list.
Create a Chart:
To analyze trends, you can create a Bar Chart by dragging artist to the axis and popularity to the values.
Step 7: Save and Share
Once you're done with your analysis, save the Power BI report by clicking File > Save As.
